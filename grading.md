Jacob: I'm impressed with the level of organization!  I saw your commits refactoring the project into the wee hours of the night.  Your project is definitely DRY.

You should be doing 10 unique events, but you're clearly demonstrating a deep understanding of the code so it is ok.

If anything, I would be a bit more descriptive of how you named the elements so it's easier to read.  Like aHeader, bATags etc
